# SI_P1_RollABall
A game consisting of clearing all the cubes while moving a ball

Move with WASD or with the arrow keys.

There is a play area with yellow and orange cubes that are rotating and a capsule that is originally yellow.

Initially yellow cubes add points when collected while orange points substract points.

When the ball collides with the capsule, the capsule changes color and so does the scoring system (now yellow cubes substract points and orange cubes add points).

The game ends when all cubes have been collected. Depending on the player's final score they will receive a fitting final message.

There's also 5 audio files, so that there's some background music, and also some triggered music when colliding with the cubes and capsule or when completing the game:
  - Background --> for the music that's playing throughtout the whole game
  - CompleteGame --> for when the game has been complited
  - PlusPoint --> for when the player collects a cube that adds 1 point
  - MinusPoint --> for when the player collects a cube that substracts 1 point
  - Switch --> for when the player collides with the capsule
